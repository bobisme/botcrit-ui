Directly mutates model. Some recursive dispatch (CommandPaletteExecute -> HideCommandPalette + action). Helpers for file navigation, scroll clamping, and thread centering.\n\n**View** (view/mod.rs): Dispatches to `review_list::view` or `review_detail::view` based on `model.screen`, then overlays command palette. Views call `buffer.draw_text()` and `buffer.fill_rect()` imperatively.\n\n**Event Loop** (main.rs): render -> check quit -> load data -> poll input -> map to message -> update. Input mapping functions serve as a \"controller\" layer. Data loading (DB queries, VCS diffs) happens as side effects in the loop.\n\n### Styling System\n\nThe `Theme` struct is the central styling authority with:\n- 7 base/UI colors (background, foreground, border, border_focused, panel_bg, selection_bg/fg, cursor)\n- 5 semantic colors (primary, success, warning, error, muted)\n- `DiffTheme` sub-struct (12 colors for diff rendering)\n- `SyntaxColors` sub-struct (11 colors for syntax highlighting)\n\nThemes are constructed from 7 \"seed\" colors with all others derived via lerp/blend. Optional overrides can fine-tune any derived color. 10 built-in themes are embedded at compile time.\n\n**How styles are applied**: Every view function accesses `model.theme` directly and constructs `Style` values inline at each draw call site. There are no pre-built \"style tokens\" or \"style constants\" -- each `buffer.draw_text()` call builds its own `Style::fg(theme.foreground).with_bg(theme.background)`.\n\n### Component System\n\n**There is no formal component system.** The closest things are:\n- `view/components.rs`: Shared primitives (Rect, draw_box, fill_rect, etc.)\n- `StreamCursor` in diff.rs: Virtual scroll abstraction tracking stream_row vs screen_row\n- Various private helper functions within each view file\n\nNo component trait, no declarative composition, no isolated/testable components. Each view is a collection of imperative draw calls.\n\n### Key Architectural Issues\n\n1. **diff.rs is 2921 lines** -- contains unified diff, side-by-side, comments, context, thread range bars, file headers, pinned headers, highlight text, text wrapping, stream orchestration, AND legacy standalone renderers\n\n2. **Duplicated layout constants** -- DIFF_H_PAD, DIFF_MARGIN, ORPHANED_CONTEXT_LEFT_PAD are defined independently in diff.rs, stream.rs, and update.rs with only comments (\"Must match DIFF_MARGIN in diff.rs\") maintaining sync\n\n3. **Stream layout must mirror rendering** -- stream.rs computes line counts that diff.rs must emit exactly, but they are separate implementations.

Fix: only match on sl.right (new side), consistent with map_threads_to_diff.\n\n2. Orphaned context exclusion ranges only covered new-side hunk lines (view/diff.rs, stream.rs). The hunk_ranges used to clip orphaned context were built from (new_start, new_start+new_count-1) only. When an orphaned thread's context window overlapped with old-side diff lines (e.g., th-1suy context 708-741 vs old-side 710-716 in hunk 2), those lines appeared in both orphaned context and the diff.

The stream layout (stream.rs) and stream rendering (diff.rs) must emit exactly matching row counts but are separate implementations -- a styling change that affects row counts (e.g., adding padding) must be changed in both places\n\n## Proposed Refactoring\n\n### Phase 1: Centralize Layout Constants (low risk, high impact)\n\nCreate `src/layout.rs` as the single source of truth for all layout constants:\n\n```rust\n// src/layout.rs\npub const DIFF_H_PAD: u32 = 0;\npub const DIFF_MARGIN: u32 = 2;\npub const ORPHANED_CONTEXT_LEFT_PAD: u32 = 2;\npub const THREAD_COL_WIDTH: u32 = 2;\npub const UNIFIED_LINE_NUM_WIDTH: u32 = 12;\npub const SBS_LINE_NUM_WIDTH: u32 = 6;\npub const CONTEXT_LINE_NUM_WIDTH: u32 = 6;\npub const DIVIDER_WIDTH: u32 = 0;\npub const COMMENT_H_MARGIN: u32 = 2;\npub const COMMENT_H_PAD: u32 = 2;\n// Block constants (already partially centralized in stream.rs):\npub const BLOCK_MARGIN: usize = 1;\npub const BLOCK_PADDING: usize = 1;\npub const BLOCK_SIDE_MARGIN: u32 = 2;\npub const BLOCK_LEFT_PAD: u32 = 2;\npub const BLOCK_RIGHT_PAD: u32 = 2;\npub const SIDE_BY_SIDE_MIN_WIDTH: u32 = 100;\n```\n\nThen derive all widths from these constants via shared functions:\n\n```rust\npub fn diff_content_width(pane_width: u32) -> u32 { ... }\npub fn unified_wrap_width(pane_width: u32) -> usize { ... }\npub fn sbs_wrap_widths(pane_width: u32) -> (usize, usize) { ... }\n```\n\ndiff.rs, stream.rs, and update.rs all import from layout.rs. This eliminates the \"Must match X in Y.rs\" comments entirely.\n\n### Phase 2: Style Tokens (low risk, medium impact)\n\nAdd computed style accessors to `Theme` itself so views use semantic style tokens instead of constructing styles inline:\n\n```rust\nimpl Theme {\n    pub fn text(&self) -> Style { Style::fg(self.foreground).with_bg(self.background) }\n    pub fn text_muted(&self) -> Style { Style::fg(self.muted).with_bg(self.background) }\n    pub fn text_bold(&self) -> Style { Style::fg(self.foreground).with_bg(self.background).with_bold() }\n    pub fn selection(&self) -> Style { Style::fg(self.selection_fg).with_bg(self.selection_bg) }\n    pub fn selection_accent(&self) -> Style { Style::fg(self.primary).with_bg(self.selection_bg) }\n    pub fn panel_text(&self) -> Style { Style::fg(self.foreground).with_bg(self.panel_bg) }\n    pub fn panel_muted(&self) -> Style { Style::fg(self.muted).with_bg(self.panel_bg) }\n    pub fn diff_added_line(&self) -> Style { Style::fg(self.diff.added).with_bg(self.diff.added_bg) }\n    pub fn diff_removed_line(&self) -> Style { Style::fg(self.diff.removed).with_bg(self.diff.removed_bg) }\n    pub fn diff_context_line(&self) -> Style { Style::fg(self.diff.context).with_bg(self.diff.context_bg) }\n    // etc.\n}\n```\n\nThis gives a vocabulary for styling that views share. When you change how \"selection\" looks, you change it once in Theme::selection() and it applies everywhere.\n\n### Phase 3: Split diff.rs into Sub-Modules (medium risk, high impact)\n\nBreak the 2921-line diff.rs into focused sub-modules:\n\n```\nsrc/view/diff/\n  mod.rs              - Re-exports, shared types (ThreadAnchor, ChangeCounts, DisplayLineKind)\n  stream.rs           - render_diff_stream orchestration (the main entry point)\n  unified.rs          - Unified diff line rendering (render_unified_diff_line_block, _wrapped_row)\n  side_by_side.rs     - Side-by-side rendering (render_side_by_side_line_block, _wrapped_row)\n  comments.rs         - Comment block rendering (emit_comment_block, draw_comment_bar)\n  context.rs          - File context and orphaned context rendering\n  header.rs           - File header blocks and pinned headers\n  highlight.rs        - draw_highlighted_text, wrap_content, wrap_highlight_spans\n  cursor.rs           - StreamCursor abstraction\n```\n\nEach sub-module handles one concern. The stream.rs orchestrator calls into the others.\n\n### Phase 4: Shared Help Bar Component (low risk, low impact)\n\nUnify the two help bar implementations into components.rs:\n\n```rust\npub struct HotkeyHint<'a> {\n    pub label: &'a str,\n    pub key: &'a str,\n}\n\npub fn draw_help_bar(\n    buffer: &mut OptimizedBuffer,\n    area: Rect,\n    theme: &Theme,\n    hints: &[HotkeyHint],\n) { ... }\n```\n\nBoth review_list.rs and review_detail.rs call this shared function.\n\n### Phase 5: Shared dim_rect (low risk, low impact)\n\nMove dim_rect into components.rs:\n\n```rust\npub fn dim_rect(buffer: &mut OptimizedBuffer, area: Rect, scale: f32) { ... }\n```\n\nreview_detail.rs calls `dim_rect(buffer, area, 0.7)` and command_palette.rs calls `dim_rect(buffer, area, 0.35)`.\n\n### Phase 6: Remove Legacy Renderers (low risk, medium impact)\n\nDelete `render_diff_with_threads`, `render_diff`, `render_diff_side_by_side`, and `render_file_context` -- the standalone renderers that `render_diff_stream` has replaced. Verify they have no remaining callers first. Currently `render_diff` calls `render_diff_with_threads` internally and `render_file_context` is re-exported in view/mod.rs but may not be called.\n\n### Phase 7 (Optional): Extract Input Mapping from main.rs\n\nMove `map_review_list_key`, `map_review_detail_key`, `map_command_palette_key`, and the mouse mapping functions into a dedicated `src/input.rs` module. This reduces main.rs from ~1233 to ~600 lines and separates the \"controller\" layer from the event loop.\n\n## Priority Order\n\n1. **Phase 1** (layout.rs) -- Eliminates the #1 source of cross-file breakage. Pure mechanical refactor with no behavior change.\n2. **Phase 2** (style tokens) -- Establishes a shared vocabulary that prevents ad-hoc style divergence. Incremental: start with the most-used patterns and expand.\n3. **Phase 3** (split diff.rs) -- Reduces the cognitive load of the largest file. Each sub-module becomes independently reviewable.\n4. **Phases 4-5** (shared help bar, dim_rect) -- Quick deduplication wins.\n5. **Phase 6** (remove legacy) -- Dead code removal.\n6. **Phase 7** (input.rs) -- Nice-to-have cleanup.\n\n## What About a Full Component System?\n\nA formal component system (e.g., a `Component` trait with `render(&self, &mut Buffer, Rect)`) would add abstraction overhead that may not pay off for a TUI of this size. The existing Elm architecture (Model/Message/Update/View) is already a good separation of concerns. The real problems are:\n\n- Constants not centralized (Phase 1 fixes this)\n- Styles not tokenized (Phase 2 fixes this)\n- One file doing too much (Phase 3 fixes this)\n- Small duplications (Phases 4-5 fix these)\n\nA component trait would mainly help if you had many independently scrollable, interactive sub-views. Currently the app has two screens (list and detail) with the diff stream being the only complex scrollable area. The `StreamCursor` already serves as a de facto rendering abstraction for that case. Adding a generic component system would likely just add indirection without solving the actual pain points.","created_at":"2026-02-02T19:08:39Z"}]}
