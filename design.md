## Blocks

Blocks use this icon, "┃" to provide contrast & vertical alignment:

┃
┃ This is called a "block." This is the block title.
┃
┃ Prefer a blank line of padding at the top and bottom of
┃ the main content of the block.
┃

┃
┃ Use 2 spaces of padding between the glyph and the start
┃ of the text and between the end of text and the end of whatever
┃ background color is used for the block.
┃
┃ Note: blocks can have footers sometimes without vertical padding.
