## Blocks

Blocks use this icon, "┃" to provide contrast & vertical alignment:

┃
┃  This is called a "block." This is the block title.
┃
┃  Prefer a blank line of padding at the top and bottom of
┃  the main content of the block.
┃

┃
┃  Use 2 spaces of padding between the glyph and the start
┃  of the text and between the end of text and the end of whatever
┃  background color is used for the block.
┃
┃  Note: blocks can have footers sometimes without vertical padding.

## Interpretation notes (proposed)

- Overall layout is a three-zone stack: left file list, top diff block, mid thread block, then another diff block below.
- Left sidebar shows review id, bookmark/commit breadcrumb, then file list with counts; selected file uses a leading arrow.
- File path header is a block with the vertical bar glyph on the left and the path text in muted white.
- The changes summary in the header uses +green and -red counts aligned to the right.
- Side-by-side diff uses two solid color panels (red for deletions, blue for additions), no visible divider line.
- Line numbers are present on both sides but the right side is more muted to reduce redundancy.
- Hunk separator is minimal (no @@ line in the main diff; separation is implied by block spacing).
- Thread block is a separate section with id on left, file+line range on right, and per-comment ids on the far right.
- Thread block uses the same vertical bar glyph and spacing rules as other blocks.
- Comments show author handles in color (blue for reviewer, green for author), followed by body text in neutral.
- Bottom-right hint shows "ctrl+p commands" as a lightweight footer.

## Streamed diff layout addendum

- The pinned current-file header uses the full block format (vertical bar, 1 row top/bottom padding inside the block, and 1 row margin above/below the block).
- All right-side sections (file header, diff, thread block) should be rendered as blocks per the block format rules.
